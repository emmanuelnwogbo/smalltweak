A simple crud app with authorization




Hey! 
I connected socket io from your server to the create.ejs view. Please look at the app.js folder and the create.ejs to see the code. Also check your package.json. I didn't do anything by way of css; but if you look at your browser console and the console of your command line you'll see that there's a connection, you can work with from there. Pls let me know if anything else.
